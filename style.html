  work and how does it relate to your other things?”</p>

 <p><p class="paragraph">-“It hard to say. I don’t believe in a natural way. A person’s style is who
 they are, and if it not, its phony. A style is your personality” –</p>

 <p> <p class="paragraph"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohZZZ8t_uc"> Rebecca Sugar Q and A</a> </p>

  <p> <p class="paragraph"> A style is who you and how you see the world in your own image.  Everyone has
   a style that is always changing. “Finding” your style is a lie simply because
    everyone has a style to begin with.  It’s developing and improving that inherit style that people need to work on, not so much finding a style.
 </p>

 <p class="paragraph"> Many artists feel like they need to be inspired by other artists and incorporate
  different ways of drawing into their own ever-changing styles. It’s okay to copy
  another person’s style of art, but claiming it as your own style is only throwing
  your personality out the window. Improving and accepting yourself is the first step
  in developing your unique style. A style is a see through glass in which, we see the
  world through your eyes.
